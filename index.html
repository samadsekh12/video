          <div class="quote"><br>Create a complete Android application using Kotlin that runs in Android Studio and supports Android 10+ with Scoped Storage. The app should allow users to scan documents in any language using the device camera. After scanning, a preview screen should display the captured image along with options for Crop, Rotate, Brightness adjustment, Retake, and Process. The UI should be clean, intuitive, and beautifully designed, with each option placed in a user-friendly layout. Auto Crop and Auto Brightness should be applied automatically after scanning—Auto Crop should trim unnecessary edges, and Auto Brightness should enhance the image clarity. If multiple files are scanned, users should be able to swipe sideways to view all scanned files. When the user clicks Process, two buttons—Download and Share—should appear below the preview. On clicking Download, the user should be able to choose between .txt and .pdf formats. If .txt is selected, the app should use ML Kit or OpenCV to extract text using OCR with Auto Language Detection (no manual language selection), supporting Bengali, Hindi, and English, and save the result as a .txt file. If .pdf is selected, the scanned image should be saved as a PDF. On clicking Share, the app should use Android’s native Share Intent to allow sharing the file via any app (e.g., WhatsApp, Gmail, Drive), using FileProvider to generate the URI. All scanned files should be saved locally using Scoped Storage. The History screen should list all scanned files with their file name and scan time, and each item should include a Process button that opens the same Download and Share options. Users should be able to merge multiple scanned pages into a single PDF, and even a single scanned page should be convertible to PDF. The Settings screen should include options to toggle Dark Mode, select app language (Bengali, Hindi, English), and adjust scan resolution or image quality. There should be no manual OCR language selection, as Auto Language Detection is always enabled. The app should follow Material Design principles and include a Bottom Navigation Bar with tabs for Home, History, and Settings. It must support offline functionality and Dark Mode. The project should be structured into the following files: MainActivity.kt, OcrProcessor.kt, PdfGenerator.kt, ImageEditor.kt, FileManager.kt, ShareUtils.kt, SettingsActivity.kt, HistoryActivity.kt, BottomNavHelper.kt, activity_main.xml, and build.gradle. Technical requirements include runtime permission checks for camera and storage, use of coroutines or background threads for UI responsiveness, try-catch blocks for error handling (e.g., missing permissions, OCR failures, file not found), and proper use of null safety and import statements in all Kotlin files. The AndroidManifest.xml must include all necessary permissions. The app should build cleanly with no Gradle sync issues, and setup instructions for Android Studio should be included. UI layouts should match reference images provided for Home, History, Settings, and Scan Preview screens.</div>
