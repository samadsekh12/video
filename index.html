          <div class="quote"><br>Create a complete Android application using Kotlin that runs in Android Studio and supports Android 10+ with Scoped Storage. The app should allow users to scan documents in any language using the device camera. After scanning, a preview screen should display the captured image along with options for Crop, Rotate, Brightness adjustment, Retake, and Process. The UI should be clean, intuitive, and beautifully designed, with each option placed in a user-friendly layout. Auto Crop and Auto Brightness should be applied automatically after scanning—Auto Crop should trim unnecessary edges, and Auto Brightness should enhance the image clarity. If multiple files are scanned, users should be able to swipe sideways to view all scanned files. When the user clicks Process, two buttons—Download and Share—should appear below the preview. On clicking Download, the user should be able to choose between .txt and .pdf formats. If .txt is selected, the app should use ML Kit or OpenCV to extract text using OCR with Auto Language Detection (no manual language selection), supporting Bengali, Hindi, and English, and save the result as a .txt file. If .pdf is selected, the scanned image should be saved as a PDF. On clicking Share, the app should use Android’s native Share Intent to allow sharing the file via any app (e.g., WhatsApp, Gmail, Drive), using FileProvider to generate the URI. All scanned files should be saved locally using Scoped Storage. The History screen should list all scanned files with their file name and scan time, and each item should include a Process button that opens the same Download and Share options. Users should be able to merge multiple scanned pages into a single PDF, and even a single scanned page should be convertible to PDF. The Settings screen should include options to toggle Dark Mode, select app language (Bengali, Hindi, English), and adjust scan resolution or image quality. There should be no manual OCR language selection, as Auto Language Detection is always enabled. The app should follow Material Design principles and include a Bottom Navigation Bar with tabs for Home, History, and Settings. It must support offline functionality and Dark Mode. The project should be structured into the following files: MainActivity.kt, OcrProcessor.kt, PdfGenerator.kt, ImageEditor.kt, FileManager.kt, ShareUtils.kt, SettingsActivity.kt, HistoryActivity.kt, BottomNavHelper.kt, activity_main.xml, and build.gradle. Technical requirements include runtime permission checks for camera and storage, use of coroutines or background threads for UI responsiveness, try-catch blocks for error handling (e.g., missing permissions, OCR failures, file not found), and proper use of null safety and import statements in all Kotlin files. The AndroidManifest.xml must include all necessary permissions. The app should build cleanly with no Gradle sync issues, and setup instructions for Android Studio should be included. UI layouts should match reference images provided for Home, History, Settings, and Scan Preview screens.</div>

          <div class="quote"><br>Build an Android application using Kotlin named Offline Image Cleaner that works entirely offline, without any internet, cloud, or server access. The app must support Android versions from API level 24 (Android 7.0) to API level 34 (Android 14). All processing must be done locally on the device, and the code should be structured so that every feature functions reliably after deployment, with no missing logic or runtime errors.
The app must include the following features: duplicate image detection using image hashing or pixel comparison; blurred image detection based on sharpness and contrast analysis; similar image grouping based on visual similarity such as pose and background; automatic screenshot categorization using filename patterns or metadata; WhatsApp media cleaner to scan and remove unused images, videos, audio, and documents; app junk cleaner to detect leftover files from uninstalled apps (cache, data, obb); large file finder to identify files over 50MB; file type filter for formats like JPG, PNG, MP4, and PDF; permanent delete mode that removes files without recovery or temporary storage; a smart suggestion panel that provides preview and cleanup recommendations; scheduled scan functionality using WorkManager or AlarmManager for weekly or monthly scans; and a battery saver mode to reduce CPU usage during scanning.
Design the UI following Material Design 3 guidelines using Jetpack Compose or ConstraintLayout. The layout must be responsive across mobile and tablet devices. The home screen should include a pie or bar chart showing storage usage, a “Scan Now” button, recent cleanup summary, a dark mode toggle, and a language selector supporting English, Hindi, and Bengali. The image cleaner screen should display a grid view of images with segmented tabs for “Duplicate,” “Blurred,” and “Similar,” along with checkbox selection and a “Preview & Clean” button. The file cleaner screen should include sections for WhatsApp media, large files, and app junk, each with file lists and a “Clean Selected” button. The suggestion screen should show preview thumbnails, accept/ignore buttons, and a summary of how much space will be freed. The settings screen should allow users to change language, toggle dark mode, configure scan schedules, and view permission status.
Ensure accessibility by implementing TalkBack support, font scaling, content descriptions, and high contrast mode for visually impaired users. Improve user experience with smooth screen transitions, loading indicators, and animations.
Handle permissions appropriately: use READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE for Android 10 and below, and MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE via Storage Access Framework or MediaStore API for Android 11 and above. Optionally include PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS if usage data is needed.
Structure the logic using MVVM architecture with modular Kotlin classes and functions. Use Kotlin Coroutines and Jetpack libraries such as WorkManager, ViewModel, LiveData, and Room. Implement robust error handling using try-catch blocks, and notify users via Snackbar or Dialog. Include fallback behavior for cases like corrupt files, denied permissions, or insufficient storage. Add confirmation dialogs before permanent deletion and request user consent for sensitive file access. Validate local storage and permissions before executing any feature.
Log all critical actions and errors to Logcat to support debugging. Optimize performance to prevent memory leaks, ANRs, and UI freezes, especially during scanning and image comparison. Include unit tests and UI tests using Espresso or JUnit, and ensure all edge cases are handled gracefully.</div>
